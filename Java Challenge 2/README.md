Write a program that takes in String inputs into an array; 
each String corresponds to a person’s name and three of their bills 
e.g. “name-electricity-water-phone” > [mike-80-90-40]. 
These String inputs will follow the aforementioned format. 
With this array of Strings, calculate which person has the 
highest bill and return the name of said person; this highest bill 
is determined by individually (per person/String) summing 
each bill together to get their respective totals. 
In the class UserMainCode, complete the static method “highestbill”; 
this method has a String array as it’s parameter. 
The return type (String) should return the name of the person with 
the highest total bill. Also assume that the bill will have only one person name, 
in the event of two persons having the same highest total score).
